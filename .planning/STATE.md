## Recent Activity

- 2026-04-11: Phase 07 Plan 02 complete — admin auth (cookie session) + Category CRUD via Server Actions
- 2026-04-11: Phase 07 Plan 01 complete — Prisma schema extended with archived/timesPlayed/timesAnsweredWrong fields; Wave 0 test stubs created; .env.example updated with Phase 7 vars
- 2026-04-11: Phase 06 complete — all 4 plans done (data layer, Double Points, Remove Two, Freeze Opponent, E2E verification); 58 server tests green, frontend builds clean
- 2026-04-09: Project initialized. PRD validated and rebuilt. PROJECT.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, ROADMAP.md, config.json created.

---

## Key Context

- Stack decided: Next.js 14 + Node.js/Socket.io + PostgreSQL + Redis + Vercel/Railway
- Arabic-first RTL UI throughout
- Builder: Claude agents via GSD workflow (no human dev team)
- 8-phase roadmap for v1.0 MVP

---

## Decisions

- Admin auth uses simple cookie session (ADMIN_SESSION_TOKEN) independent of NextAuth — no DB lookup needed
- Admin middleware check lives inside NextAuth auth() callback wrapper for edge compatibility
- Web app prisma/schema.prisma extended with Category+Question models so @prisma/client includes admin types
- force-dynamic added to DB-reading Server Components to prevent build-time prerender without DATABASE_URL

---

## Open Questions

- Will host need an account to create a room, or anonymous room creation?
- Minimum question bank size confirmed at 200 (across 6 categories)
- Is there a practice/solo mode, or multiplayer-required?
- Free Text voting: players only, or host override?
